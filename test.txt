<p>History through News is an application designed to give users an indepth view of a specific time period reconstructed through historical newspaper articles. The idea behind History through News is to extract from historical news 
articles information that will give the audience an understanding of what life is like during any time period in the past. In todays society, if we want to find out events that our society is interested in, social trends that 
are popular or foreign affairs that people are concerned about, we can easily find all these information via the internet and social networking websites. This is because many people owns a computer or a smart phone and they can 
easily voice their concerns by tweeting, posting on forums or update their Faceboook feed.</p>

<p>However, if we want to find similar information such as foreign events that concerns our society or what our society is interested prior to the invention of the computer and the internet, where do we find this information?
During the pre-computer age, the most dominant form of communication and circulating information is via newspapers and our assumption is that we can find all these information from newspaper headlines. 
As an experiment, we downloaded about 250,000+ historical (Sydney Morning Herald) newspaper records via the Trove API. We applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the newspaper headlines to extract vital information 
such as events, location, people etc. By performing statistical analysis on these extracted information, we calculated the most frequently used keywords found in headlines and use these keywords to find relevant articles and 
pictures to help identify what society cares most during that time period.</p>

<p>In our experiment, we found that during 1915-1919, there are alot of articles relating to the army, USA, germany, soldiers, food, invasion etc. From these keywords, it is very clear that during this time period there is a war 
happening and our society is most concerned with soldiers and food.
We then fast tracked to another period in the 1924-1928 and in this period we see keywords such as tennis, olympic, football, golf etc. In comparison to the 1915-1919 period, this suggests that there are no war or disaster that
happened and society focus more on recreational activities such the as the 1924 Olympic games. Finally, we performed the same experiment for the years between 1943-1945, we see the same similar patterns with 1915-1919. During this
period of time, the keywords from headlines convey a very serious and depressing theme where most keywords are concerned with war, army, raid, battle etc.</p>

<p>From this experiment we found that by analysing newspaper articles we can extract vital information that can help the audience construct what life is like during any specific time period in the past. In addition, from the experiment
we have created a catalog of newspaper article to keyword mappings which we are more than happy to open source it. These keywords can be added to the existing Trove dataset or can be used as tags for the articles.
